This folder composed of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) implementation.
The file Hamiltonian Cycles.ipynb is used to generate a cycle with special properties called 'Hamiltonian Cycle' from a given Barnette Graph with a decent accuracy. This was result of work for my minor project under the guidance of Dr. Saptarshi Bej (sbej7042@iisertvm.ac.in). In this work, we build a GNN model heavily inspired with Transformer with certain modifications in it.
Image Recognition.ipynb file is yet another potential application to Transformer based model where we try to exploit its nature of spatial information preservation property necessary for image-based classification. This work is heavily inspired from above code.
